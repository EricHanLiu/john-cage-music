# John Cage Music Generator
## This script was created for a Music Literature assignment, where we had to compose a piece in the style of John Cage.
# What does it do?
## In keeping with the spirit of Mr. Cage and his admiration of chance and randomness in music, this program will generate a random sequence of notes and rhythms for your piano composition, and generates two hands worth of music.
# How to use it?
## It's pretty straightforward once you get in the program, but you basically have two options.
1. Generates a 4/4 bar of two hand piano music (rhythmic constraint).
2. Generates a sequence of 8 notes in each hand (no rhythmic constraint).

#Note
##The left hand is limited to simpler rhythms so your piece is still playable, while the right hand can have up to 16th note rhythms. 
# WIP
## There's still much for me to add, such as more complex rhythms and etc. Stay tuned!
