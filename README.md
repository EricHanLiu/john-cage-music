# John Cage Music Generator
## This script was created for a Music Literature assignment, where we had to compose a piece in the style of John Cage.
# What does it do?
## In keeping with the spirit of Mr. Cage and his admiration of chance and randomness in music, this program will generate a random sequence of notes and rhythms for your composition.
# How to use it?
## It's pretty straightforward once you get in the program, but you basically have two options.
1. Generates a single 4/4 bar of music (rhythmic constraint).
2. Generates a sequence of 8 notes (no rhythmic constraint).

# WIP
## There's still much for me to add, such as more complex rhythms and etc. Stay tuned!
